NETWORKING BASICS
TYPES OF NETWORKS
1.PAN (Personal Area Network)
2.LAN (Local Area Network)
3.MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)
4.WAN (Wide Area Network)


What Is Local Area Network (LAN)?
The Local Area Network (LAN) is designed to connect multiple network devices
and systems within a limited geographical distance.

ATTRIBUTES OF LAN NETWORK
a. The data transmit speed in the LAN network is relatively higher than the other
network types MAN and WAN.

What Is Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)?
The Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) is a network type that covers the network
connection of an entire city or connection of a small area.

ATTRIBUTES OF MAN NETWORK
a. Network covers an entire town area or a portion of a city.
b. Data transmission speed is relatively high due to the installation of optical
cables and wired connections.


What Is Wide Area Network (WAN)?
The Wide Area Network (WAN) is designed to connect devices over large distances
like states or between countries.



THE OSI MODEL
The OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection Model) is a conceptual framework used to
describe the functions of a networking system.

THE 7 LAYERS OF OSI MODELS
1. physical layer
2. data link layer
3. network layer
4. transport layer
5. session layer
6. presentation layer
7. application layer


THE INTERNET
is the global system of interconnected computer networks that uses the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to communicate between networks and devices.
